 * @defgroup pkg_orphans Package orphans handling functions
 *
 * Functions to find installed package orphans.
 *
 * Package orphans were installed automatically by another package,
 * but currently no other packages are depending on.
 *
 * The following image shown below shows the registered packages database
 * dictionary (the array returned by xbps_find_pkg_orphans() will
 * contain a package dictionary per orphan found):
 *
 * @image html images/xbps_pkgdb_dictionary.png
 *
 * Legend:
 *  - <b>Salmon filled box</b>: \a pkgdb plist internalized.
 *  - <b>White filled box</b>: mandatory objects.
 *  - <b>Grey filled box</b>: optional objects.
 *  - <b>Green filled box</b>: possible value set in the object, only one
 *    of them is set.
 * 
 * Text inside of white boxes are the key associated with the object, its
 * data type is specified on its edge, i.e array, bool, integer, string,
 * dictionary.
