.Sh NAME
.Nm xbps-fbulk
.Nd XBPS utility to perform a fast bulk build of void-packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xbps-fbulk
.Op OPTIONS
.Ar /path/to/void-packages
.Op pkgN pkgN+1 ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility iterates all srcpkg directories in the
.Xr void-packages
repository or processes the
.Xr pkgN
arguments, and then runs
.Ar ./xbps-src show-build-deps',
to build a dependency tree on the fly.
.Pp
As the dependency tree is being built, terminal dependencies are built
and packaged on the fly.
.Pp
As these builds complete additional dependencies may be satisfied and be
added to the build order. Ultimately the entire tree is built.
.Pp
Only one attempt is made to build any given package, no matter how many
other packages depend on it.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Fl a Ar arch
Set a different target architecture, useful for cross compiling.
.It Fl j Ar X
Set number of parallel builds running at the same time. By default set to 1.
.It Fl l Ar logdir
Set the log directory. By default set to `log.<pid>`.
.It Fl d, Fl -debug
Enables extra debugging shown to stderr.
.It Fl h, Fl -help
Show the help message.
.It Fl v, Fl -verbose
Enables verbose messages.
.It Fl V, Fl -version
Show the version information.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width logdir/skipped
.It Ar logdir/run
Packages that are being built.
.It Ar logdir/good
Packages that were built successfully.
.It Ar logdir/bad
Packages that failed to build.
.It Ar logdir/skipped
Packages that were not built because they had to be skipped (unsupported architecture, broken or restricted).
.It Ar logdir/deps
Packages that were not built due to missing dependencies.
.El
.Sh NOTES
The
.Ar masterdir
in the
.Ar void-packages
repository must be fully populated for chroot operations, and some options
need to be set in
.Ar etc/conf
to make
.Nm
work correctly:
.Bl -tag -width XBPS_CHROOT_CMD=uchroot
.It Ar XBPS_CHROOT_CMD=uchroot
The
.Xr xbps-uchroot 1
utility is required because
.Nm
builds packages in temporary masterdirs that are mounted with
.Ar overlayfs .
.El
.Pp
Make sure the user running
.Nm
has rights to execute
.Xr xbps-uchroot 1
and the kernel supports the overlay filesystem, introduced in 4.0.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was originally written by
.An Matthew Dillon <dillon@backplane.com>
for the
.Ar DragonFlyBSD project.
.Pp
.An Juan Romero Pardines <xtraeme@gmail.com>
adapted it for xbps and added some new features.
.Sh BUGS
Probably, but I try to make this not happen. Use it under your own
responsibility and enjoy your life.
