.Sh NAME
.Nm xbps-install
.Nd XBPS utility to (re)install and update packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op OPTIONS
.Op PKG...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs, reinstalls, downgrades and updates packages in the target root directory.
The argument
.Ar PKG
is a package expression, which is explained in the
.Em PACKAGE EXPRESSION
section.
.Pp
If package is installed, it will be updated to the version available in repositories
matching the
.Em PACKAGE EXPRESSION .
Otherwise it will be installed, or reinstalled/downgraded if
.Fl f , Fl -force
option is set.
.Sh PACKAGE EXPRESSION
A package expression is a form to match a pattern; currently xbps
supports 3 ways to specify them:
.Bl -dash
.It
by package name, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo .
.It
by exact package name and version, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo-1.0_1 .
.It
by specifying a package name and version separated by any of the following version comparators:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Sy <
less than
.It
.Sy >
greater than
.It
.Sy <=
less or equal than
.It
.Sy >=
greater or equal than
.Pp
Example:
.Dq Sy foo>=2.0 .
.El
.El
.Pp
The first repository matching the package expression wins.
.Sh PACKAGE MODES
An installed package can have some specific modes of operation.
Currently the following modes are available:
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Sy hold
The package is on hold mode.
Packages in this mode won't be updated unless
it's explicitely declared to be updated.
The only way to update packages in this mode is by using the
.Fl f , Fl -force
option.
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm xbps-query Fl H .
.It Sy manual
The package is in manual mode of installation and won't be considered for
removal when running
.Nm xbps-remove Fl o .
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm xbps-query Fl m .
.It Sy repolock
A package in repolock mode will only accept updates that are available in the
same repository that was used for installing.
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm xbps-query Fl -list-repolock-pkgs .
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Fl A , Fl -automatic
Enables automatic installation mode, i.e. package will be treated as orphan
if no package is depending on it directly.
.No See Fl -mode Sy auto No in Xr xbps-pkgdb 1 .
.It Fl C , Fl -config Ar dir
Specifies a path to the XBPS configuration directory.
If the first character is not '/' then it's a relative path of
.Ar rootdir .
.It Fl c , Fl -cachedir Ar dir
Specifies a path to the cache directory, where binary packages are stored.
If the first character is not '/' then it's a relative path of
.Ar rootdir .
.It Fl d , Fl -debug
Enables extra debugging shown to stderr.
.It Fl D , Fl -download-only
Only download packages to the cache, do not do any other installation steps.
This may be useful for doing system upgrades while offline, or automatically
downloading updates while leaving you with the option of still manually running
the update.
.It Fl f , Fl -force
Force installation (downgrade if package version in repos is less than installed version),
or reinstallation (if package version in repos is the same) to the target
.Ar PKG ,
overwriting regular package files and symlinks (if they have been modified) but
.Em preserving configuration files .
The only way to update packages on
.Em hold
mode is by using this flag.
If
.Fl f
is specified twice all files will be unpacked, even
.Em configuration files .
.It Fl h , Fl -help
Show the help message.
.It Fl I , Fl -ignore-file-conflicts
Ignore detected file conflicts in a transaction.
.It Fl i , Fl -ignore-conf-repos
Ignore repositories defined in configuration files.
Only repositories specified in the command line via
.Ar --repository
will be used.
.It Fl M , Fl -memory-sync
For remote repositories, the data is fetched and stored in memory for the current
operation.
Cached on-disk repository indexes of remote repositories will be ignored.
.It Fl n , Fl -dry-run
Dry-run mode.
Show what actions would be done but don't change any state of the system.
To use a fresh repository indexes use
.Fl M
for in memory sync.
.Pp
The output will be a line for each action in the following format:
.D1 <pkgver> <action> <arch> <repository> <installedsize> <downloadsize>
.It Fl R , Fl -repository Ar url
Appends the specified repository to the top of the list.
The
.Ar url
argument expects a URL to the repository for remote repositories or
a path for local repositories.
Note that remote repositories must be signed using
.Xr xbps-rindex 1 .
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl -reproducible
Enables reproducible mode in pkgdb.
The
.Ar install-date
and
.Ar repository
package objects are not stored in pkgdb.
.It Fl -staging
Enables the use of staged packages from remote repositories.
.It Fl r , Fl -rootdir Ar dir
Specifies a full path for the target root directory.
.It Fl S , Fl -sync
Synchronize remote repository index files.
.It Fl U , Fl -unpack-only
If set, packages to be installed or upgraded in the transaction won't be configured,
just unpacked.
That means that those packages should be reconfigured via
.Xr xbps-reconfigure 1 .
.It Fl u , Fl -update
Performs a full system upgrade: all installed packages
.Pq except those on Sy hold , No see Fl -mode Sy hold No in Xr xbps-pkgdb 1
will be updated to the greatest
versions that were found in repositories.
.It Fl v , Fl -verbose
Enables verbose messages.
.It Fl y , Fl -yes
Assume yes to most questions and avoid interactive questions.
A prompt will still be shown if the transaction requires trusting
a new signing key for packages.
If you need to automate new installations,
it is necessary to add these keys to the system before installation, see
.Sx FILES .
.It Fl V , Fl -version
Show the version information.
