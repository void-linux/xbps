.Nd XBPS utility to report/fix issues and modify the package database (pkgdb)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xbps-pkgdb
.Op OPTIONS
.Op PKGNAME...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can check/fix issues and modify the package database (pkgdb).
It's able to check for missing dependencies, modified files and symlinks,
alternatives and more errors that have been fixed in newer versions of xbps.
A mode to update the format to the latest version is also available.
This is the list of things that
.Nm
currently does:
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Sy METADATA CHECK
Checks that package metadata files have not been modified by comparing original
hash that is recorded when package is installed against current one.
.It Sy FILES CHECK
Checks that all files belonging to a package have not been modified and are
not missing.
For regular files, its modification time and the SHA256 hash are
compared and checked if they differ.
For symbolic links the target file is checked that it has not been modified.
.It Sy DEPENDENCIES CHECK
Checks that all required dependencies for a package are resolved.
.It Sy ALTERNATIVES CHECK
Checks that all alternatives symlinks for set alternatives groups are correct.
.It Sy OBSOLETE METADATA CHECK
Checks that the package database does not contain obsolete data from previous
XBPS versions and removes them if found.
.It Sy FORMAT CONVERSION
Updates the pkgdb format to the latest version.
