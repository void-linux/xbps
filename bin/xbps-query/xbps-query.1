.Dt XBPS-QUERY 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm xbps-query
.Nd XBPS utility to query for package and repository information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xbps-query
.Op OPTIONS
.Ar MODE
.Op ARGUMENTS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints information of a specific package or packages stored
in target root directory or in registered repositories.
The argument
.Ar PKG
is a package expression, which is explained in the
.Em PACKAGE EXPRESSION
section.
.Sh PACKAGE EXPRESSION
A package expression is a form to match a pattern; currently xbps
supports 3 ways to specify them:
.Bl -dash
.It
by package name, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo .
.It
by exact package name and version, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo-1.0_1 .
.It
by specifying a package name and version separated by any of the following version comparators:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Sy <
less than
.It
.Sy >
greater than
.It
.Sy <=
less or equal than
.It
.Sy >=
greater or equal than
.Pp
Example:
.Dq Sy foo>=2.0 .
.El
.El
.Pp
The first repository matching the package expression wins.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Fl C, Fl -config Ar dir
Specifies a path to the XBPS configuration directory.
If the first character is not '/' then it's a relative path of
.Ar rootdir .
.It Fl c, Fl -cachedir Ar dir
Specifies a path to the cache directory, where binary packages are stored.
If the first character is not '/' then it's a relative path of
.Ar rootdir .
.It Fl d, Fl -debug
Enables extra debugging shown to stderr.
.It Fl h, Fl -help
Show the help message.
.It Fl i, Fl -ignore-conf-repos
Ignore repositories defined in configuration files.
Only repositories specified in the command line via
.Ar --repository
will be used.
.It Fl M, Fl -memory-sync
For remote repositories, the data is fetched and stored in memory for the current
operation. This ignores the existing on-disk repository archives in rootdir.
.It Fl p, Fl -property Ar PROP[,...]
Only match this package property.
Multiple properties can be specified by delimiting them with commas.
.It Fl R
Enable repository mode. This mode explicitly looks in repositories, rather
than looking in the target root directory.
.It Fl -repository=url
Appends the specified repository to the top of the list. The
.Ar url
argument expects a URL to the repository for remote repositories or
a path for local repositories.  Note that remote repositories must be signed
using
.Xr xbps-rindex 1 .
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl -regex
Enables string matching by using Extended Regular Expressions in compatible modes,
currently in the
.Sy ownedby
and
.Sy search
modes.
.It Fl -fulldeptree
Prints a full dependency tree in the
.Sy show dependencies
mode.
.It Fl r, Fl -rootdir Ar dir
Specifies a full path for the target root directory.
.It Fl v, Fl -verbose
Enables verbose messages.
.It Fl V, Fl -version
Show the version information.
.El
.Sh MODE
Only one of the following modes can be used at a time.
By default and unless the
.Fl R
option is specified, the target
.Ar PKG
will be queried in the root directory, otherwise it will be
queried in registered repositories.
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Fl l, Fl -list-pkgs
Lists registered packages in the package database (pkgdb).
A package can be in any of the following states:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Sy ii
Package is installed.
.It
.Sy uu
Package is unpacked but must be configured with
.Xr xbps-reconfigure 1 .
.It
.Sy hr
Package is
.Sy half-removed ,
and can be fully removed with
.Xr xbps-remove 1 .
.It
.Sy ??
Package state is unknown.
.El
.It Fl H, Fl -list-hold-pkgs
List registered packages in the package database (pkgdb) that are on
.Sy hold .
Such packages won't be updated automatically.
.It Fl L, Fl -list-repos
Lists repositories and the number of packages contained on them. If a repository is not
available the number of packages will be
.Sy -1 .
The
.Fl v
option can be used to show more detailed information of remote repositories.
.It Fl m, Fl -list-manual-pkgs
Lists registered packages in the package database (pkgdb) that were installed
manually by the user (i.e not as dependency of any package).
.It Fl O, Fl -list-orphans
Lists package orphans in the package database (pkgdb), i.e packages that
were installed as dependencies and no package is currently depending on them
directly.
.It Fl o, Fl -ownedby Ar PATTERN [ Fl -repository ] [ Fl -regex ]
Search for installed package files by matching
.Ar PATTERN .
The
.Ar PATTERN
argument can be a simple string, a shell wildcard pattern as explained in
.Xr fnmatch 3
or an Extended Regular Expression as explained in
.Xr regex 7
(if
.Fl -regex
option is set).
If the
.Fl -repository
option is set, the matched
.Ar PATTERN
in repositories will be shown.
.It Fl S, Fl -show Ar PKG [ Fl -repository ] [ Fl -property Ar PROP ]
Shows information of an installed package. This is the default mode
if no other mode is set.
If the
.Fl -repository
option is set, the matched
.Ar PKG
in repositories will be shown.
If a package property is specified with
.Fl -property,
only that property will be shown.
.It Fl s, Fl -search Ar PATTERN [ Fl -repository ] [ Fl -property Ar PROP ] [ Fl -regex ]
Search for packages by matching
.Ar PATTERN
on its
.Em pkgver
and/or
.Em short_desc
properties. The same rules explained in the
.Fl -ownedby
option are applied, but a
.Sy PACKAGE EXPRESSION
is also supported.
If a package property is specified with
.Fl -property,
all packages matching
.Ar PATTERN
against
.Ar PROP
will be shown.
.It Fl f, Fl -files Ar PKG [ Fl -repository ]
Show the package files for
.Ar PKG .
If the
.Fl -repository
option is set, the matched
.Ar PKG
in repositories will be shown.
.It Fl x, Fl -deps Ar PKG [ Fl -repository ]
Show the required dependencies for
.Ar PKG .
Only direct dependencies are shown. To see a full dependency tree, also set
.Fl -fulldeptree .
If the
.Fl -repository
option is set, the matched
.Ar PKG
in repositories will be shown.
.It Fl X, Fl -revdeps Ar PKG [ Fl -repository ]
Show the reverse dependencies for
.Ar PKG .
If the
.Fl -repository
option is set, the matched
.Ar PKG
in repositories will be shown.
.It Fl -cat Ar FILE Ar PKG
Prints the file
.Ar FILE
stored in binary package
.Ar PKG
to stdout. The first repository matching the
.Ar PKG
expression wins.
This expects an absolute path.
This mode only works with repositories.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width XBPS_TARGET_ARCH
.It Sy XBPS_ARCH
Overrides
.Xr uname 2
machine result with this value. Useful to install packages with a fake
architecture.
.It Sy XBPS_TARGET_ARCH
Sets the target architecture to this value. This variable differs from
.Sy XBPS_ARCH
in that it allows you to install packages partially, because
configuration phase is skipped (the target binaries might not be compatible with
the native architecture).
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/db/xbps/.<pkgname>-files.plist
.It Ar /etc/xbps.d
Default configuration directory.
.It Ar /usr/share/xbps.d
Default system configuration directory.
.It Ar /var/db/xbps/.<pkgname>-files.plist
Package files metadata.
.It Ar /var/db/xbps/pkgdb-0.38.plist
Default package database (0.38 format). Keeps track of installed packages and properties.
.It Ar /var/cache/xbps
Default cache directory to store downloaded binary packages.
