.Sh NAME
.Nm xbps-query
.Nd XBPS utility to query for package and repository information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op OPTIONS
.Ar MODE
.Op ARGUMENTS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints information of a specific package or packages stored
in target root directory or in registered repositories.
The argument
.Ar PKG
is a package expression, which is explained in the
.Em PACKAGE EXPRESSION
section.
.Sh PACKAGE EXPRESSION
A package expression is a form to match a pattern; currently xbps
supports 3 ways to specify them:
.Bl -dash
.It
by package name, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo .
.It
by exact package name and version, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo-1.0_1 .
.It
by specifying a package name and version separated by any of the following version comparators:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Sy <
less than
.It
.Sy >
greater than
.It
.Sy <=
less or equal than
.It
.Sy >=
greater or equal than
.Pp
Example:
.Dq Sy foo>=2.0 .
.El
.El
.Pp
The first repository matching the package expression wins.
.Sh PACKAGE MODES
An installed package can have some specific modes of operation.
Currently the following modes are available:
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Sy hold
The package is on hold mode.
Packages in this mode won't be updated unless it's explicitely declared to be updated.
The only way to update packages in this mode is by using the
.Fl f, Fl -force
option.
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm xbps-query Fl H .
.It Sy manual
The package is in manual mode of installation and won't be considered for
removal when running
.Nm xbps-remove Fl o .
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm xbps-query Fl m .
.It Sy repolock
A package in repolock mode will only accept updates that are available in the
same repository that was used for installing.
To list packages in this mode use
.Nm xbps-query Fl -list-repolock-pkgs .
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Fl C, Fl -config Ar dir
Specifies a path to the XBPS configuration directory.
If the first character is not '/' then it's a relative path of
.Ar rootdir .
.It Fl c, Fl -cachedir Ar dir
Specifies a path to the cache directory, where binary packages are stored.
If the first character is not '/' then it's a relative path of
.Ar rootdir .
.It Fl d, Fl -debug
Enables extra debugging shown to stderr.
.It Fl h, Fl -help
Show the help message.
.It Fl i, Fl -ignore-conf-repos
Ignore repositories defined in configuration files.
Only repositories specified in the command line via
.Ar --repository
will be used.
.It Fl M, Fl -memory-sync
For remote repositories, the data is fetched and stored in memory for the current
operation.
This ignores the existing on-disk repository archives in rootdir.
.It Fl p, Fl -property Ar PROP[,...]
Only match this package property.
Multiple properties can be specified by delimiting them with commas.
For a list of available properties, see the
.Sx PROPERTIES
section.
.It Fl R
Enable repository mode.
This mode explicitly looks in repositories, rather
than looking in the target root directory.
.It Fl -repository Ar url
Enables repository mode and adds the specified repository to the top of the list.
The
.Ar url
argument expects a URL to the repository for remote repositories or
a path for local repositories.
Note that remote repositories must be signed using
.Xr xbps-rindex 1 .
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl -regex
Enables string matching by using Extended Regular Expressions in compatible modes,
currently in the
.Sy ownedby
and
.Sy search
modes.
.It Fl -fulldeptree
Prints a full dependency tree in the
.Sy show dependencies
mode.
.It Fl -staging
Enables the use of staged packages from remote repositories.
.It Fl r, Fl -rootdir Ar dir
Specifies a full path for the target root directory.
.It Fl v, Fl -verbose
Enables verbose messages.
.It Fl V, Fl -version
Show the version information.
.El
.Sh MODE
Only one of the following modes can be used at a time.
By default and unless the
.Fl R
option is specified, the target
.Ar PKG
will be queried in the root directory, otherwise it will be
queried in registered repositories.
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Fl l, Fl -list-pkgs
Lists registered packages in the package database (pkgdb).
A package can be in any of the following states:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Sy ii
Package is installed.
.It
.Sy uu
Package is unpacked but must be configured with
.Xr xbps-reconfigure 1 .
.It
.Sy hr
Package is
.Sy half-removed ,
and can be fully removed with
.Xr xbps-remove 1 .
.It
.Sy ??
Package state is unknown.
.El
.It Fl L, Fl -list-repos
Lists repositories and the number of packages contained on them.
If a repository is not available the number of packages will be
.Sy -1 .
The
.Fl v
option can be used to show more detailed information of remote repositories.
.It Fl H, Fl -list-hold-pkgs
List registered packages in the package database (pkgdb) that are on
.Sy hold .
Such packages won't be updated automatically.
.It Fl m, Fl -list-manual-pkgs
Lists registered packages in the package database (pkgdb) that were installed
manually by the user (i.e not as dependency of any package).
.It Fl O, Fl -list-orphans
Lists package orphans in the package database (pkgdb), i.e packages that
were installed as dependencies and no package is currently depending on them
directly.
.It Fl -list-repolock-pkgs
Lists packages that are in repolock mode.
See the
.Em PACKAGE MODES
section for more information.
.It Fl o, Fl -ownedby Ar PATTERN [ Fl R ] [ Fl -regex ]
Search for installed package files by matching
.Ar PATTERN .
The
.Ar PATTERN
argument can be a simple string, a shell wildcard pattern as explained in
.Xr fnmatch 3
or an Extended Regular Expression as explained in
.Xr regex 7
(if
.Fl -regex
option is set).
If the
.Fl R
option is set, the matched
.Ar PATTERN
in repositories will be shown.
.It Fl S, Fl -show Ar PKG [ Fl R ] [ Fl -property Ar PROP ]
Shows information of an installed package.
This is the default mode if no other mode is set.
If the
.Fl R
option is set, the matched
.Ar PKG
in repositories will be shown.
If a package property is specified with
.Fl -property,
only that property will be shown.
.It Fl s, Fl -search Ar PATTERN [ Fl R ] [ Fl -property Ar PROP ] [ Fl -regex ]
Search for packages by matching
.Ar PATTERN
on its
.Em pkgver
and/or
.Em short_desc
properties.
The same rules explained in the
.Fl -ownedby
option are applied, but a
.Sy PACKAGE EXPRESSION
is also supported.
If a package property is specified with
.Fl -property,
all packages matching
.Ar PATTERN
against
.Ar PROP
will be shown.
.It Fl f, Fl -files Ar PKG [ Fl R ]
Show the package files for
.Ar PKG .
If the
.Fl R
option is set, the matched
.Ar PKG
in repositories will be shown.
.It Fl x, Fl -deps Ar PKG [ Fl R ]
Show the required dependencies for
.Ar PKG .
Only direct dependencies are shown.
To see a full dependency tree, also set
.Fl -fulldeptree .
If the
.Fl R
option is set, the matched
.Ar PKG
in repositories will be shown.
.It Fl X, Fl -revdeps Ar PKG [ Fl R ]
Show the reverse dependencies for
.Ar PKG .
If the
.Fl R
option is set, the matched
.Ar PKG
in repositories will be shown.
.It Fl -cat Ar FILE Ar PKG
Prints the file
.Ar FILE
stored in binary package
.Ar PKG
to stdout.
The first repository matching the
.Ar PKG
expression wins.
This expects an absolute path.
This mode only works with repositories.
